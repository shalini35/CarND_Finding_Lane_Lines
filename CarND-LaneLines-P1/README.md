Overview
---

When we drive, we use our eyes to decide where to go.  The lines on the road that show us where the lanes are act as our constant reference for where to steer the vehicle.  Naturally, one of the first things we would like to do in developing a self-driving car is to automatically detect lane lines using an algorithm.

In this project lane lines are detected in images using Python and OpenCV.  OpenCV means "Open-Source Computer Vision", which is a package that has many useful tools for analyzing images.  

Prerequisites

To run this project, you need Miniconda installed.

Create an environment for the project using the command:
    conda env create -f environment.yml

After the environment is created, it needs to be activated with the command:
    source activate carnd-term1
after that, open the jupyter notebook P1.ipynb using the command:
    jupyter notebook P1.ipynb


The Repo contains the jupyter notebook P1.ipynb where the processing pipeline is implemented.
